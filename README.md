# FOKUS SENTIMENT

This is the playground where we train bas norwegian NLP algorithm
that will recognize `positive`, `negative`, `ironical` and
`sarcastic` sentiment. Also add the other explanations

# CORPUS

We are going to use the Negative and Positive words to loop through sentences and determine
positive and negative. Also, we will use possesive words and gender to understand further.
We need more positive and negative nouns, pronouns and modifiers.

# PRETRAINING

Will be done using Keras in TensorFlow. Waiting for full scraping of blogs and texts to get a 
train dataset with 5 different categories: Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative and 
Very Negative.
